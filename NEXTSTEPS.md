NEXTSTEPS
=========

 - the mouse should be a fishhook!
 - when we click objects they enter the briefcase
 - objects in the briefcase are black and white icon sized versions
 - in the briefcase, every object has an ear
 - in the briefcase, the mouse is a conch
 - click to open and close the briefcase
 - clicking on the ear plays the audio
 - dragging the objects sends them back into the sea
 - when the briefcase is full, clicking on objects
   does not add them to the briefcase
 - when an object does not get added, we play a clip
 - the title screen should be a conch, maybe flickering infront of an ear
 - the text for each object is displayed in conch hidden
   off-screen
 - gradually, as the game progresses, the conch cross-fades with an ear

MAYBE
 - maybe add some layers to things so that they have more
   than one identity
