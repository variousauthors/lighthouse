NEXTSTEPS
=========

[ ] shrink images with tinypng
[ ] make sounds load lazily
[ ] ensure sounds can't play over eachother (maybe
    use the "no good" cursor instead of the conch
    during audio)

[x] the mouse should be a fishhook!
[ ] the hook should become a conch when the briefcase is full
[x] over the ear, the mouse is a conch

[x] when we click objects they enter the briefcase
[ ] objects in the briefcase are black and white icon sized versions
[x] in the briefcase, every object has an ear
[x] clicking on the ear plays the audio
[x] the ear is small and appears on the object
[ ] briefcase objects should not shuffle about: they should
    stay in the position they were added as

[ ] click to open and close the briefcase

[x] dragging the objects sends them back into the sea
[ ] when an object does not get added, we play a clip
[x] when the briefcase is full, clicking on objects
    does not add them to the briefcase

[x] the title screen should be a conch, maybe flickering infront of an ear
[ ] the text for each object is displayed in conch hidden
    off-screen
[ ] gradually, as the game progresses, the conch cross-fades with an ear

[ ] debris should appear wholly inside the frame

[ ] integrate the combined lighthouse/briefcase image
[ ] make objects and ears not have a hierarchical relationship, so
    they can have different mouseover icons

MAYBE
 - maybe add some layers to things so that they have more
   than one identity
